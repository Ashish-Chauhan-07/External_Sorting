# External_Sorting
External Sorting is a class of algorithms used to deal with massive amounts of data that do not fit in memory
<br><br>
- K-Way merge sort algorithm to sort a very large array of integers.
- Tackled by breaking the problem space into small computable subspaces and then operations are done on them.
- Input : A file containing a large unsorted list of integers (taht will not fit in usual RAM of the system).
- Output : A file containing non-Descending sorted list of the given integers.
